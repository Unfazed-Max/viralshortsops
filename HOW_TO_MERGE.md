# How to Complete the Merge to Main

This document explains how to merge this PR to the main branch.

## Current Status ✅

- ✅ Added comprehensive documentation

## What Was Merged

**Selected Branch:** `copilot/add-video-generation-feature-2` (monorepo implementation)

**Why this branch?**

- Review `MERGE_SUMMARY.md` for merge information
- Check `.env.example` for required environment variables

## Notes

- The project uses pnpm workspace and Turborepo for monorepo management
- Redis connection warnings during build are expected (code initializes Redis at module level)
- No automated tests exist yet - consider adding them in future PRs
- Environment variables use safe defaults for development but should be configured for production
